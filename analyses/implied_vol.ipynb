    "This notebook compares options on a stock and their implied volatilities with the observed volatilities in the past. The stock chosen is alphabet, since it conveniently does not pay any dividends and is fairly liquid. The analysis is done with historic closing data for GOOG up until 2020-12-29 and option price data at some time on that last day. Since I did not find freely available historic option price data, longitudinal analysis are unfortunately not possible."

    "There are some remarkable features to be observed here:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Put- call difference**: Puts have the higher implied volatility (aka are more expensive) than call options (on GOOG). While this does not necessarily follow the theory behind BS, I found plausible explanations explaining this difference by the higher demand for puts (\"insurance\" against downturns) than for calls. This would mean that the \"true\" expected volatility lies somewhere in between those two lines. Could an options trader then not make money over the long term by being on the opposide side of those trades? One problem could be that since in crises most asset classes are correlated and losses on puts are unbounded, this could wipe out the trader. Would be interesting to discuss with someone who has knowledge about this. Please contact me if you do and would be willing to discuss!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference between dates**: According to hull (Chapter 20), volatility expectations are mean-reverting which, if the reason for the decrease in implied volatility on the later contract, would mean that the volatility expected between the two expiry dates is lower than the one up to the first expiry date. Without evidence I could also see part of the reason being the end of the year (window dressing?), but without historic data, this is hard to confirm. Unfortunately, I did not find historic option prices freely available online, so these hypotheses cannot really be tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lack of decreate for calls**: interestingly, the call smile is significantly flatter than the put smile, with the implied volatility even increasing for low strikes. If, as argued for the put-call difference, the implied volatilities reflect supply and demand, then this would mean that the demand for low strikes strongly tails off towards lower and lower strikes.\n"

Over \"similar\" window sizes (aka 28/38 days), the volatilities are very comparable. However, going further back, the volatilities were obviously considerable higher (March 2020 clearly visible). Interesting is the precipitous drop around 40 days. After mid to end October, the price seems to have been rather stable. It appears the markets assume this stability to continue in the near future."

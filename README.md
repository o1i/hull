# Hull playground
This repo is an attempt to apply the content of Hull's book 'Options, Futures and other Derivatives' (10th edition) 
to real world data
in order to deepen my understanding of its contents. I make no claims regarding the correctness or efficiency of the 
implementations and welcome any input to improve the code.

The data used is (mostly) obtained from https://www.cmegroup.com or https://cboe.com.

## Analyses
Notebooks demonstrating the methods on real or simulated data

## Data
Raw data as found freely available on the internet (i.e. without the need for registration or behind paywall, to
allow reproduction of the results without getting into trouble in terms of licenses)

## Methods
The actual implementation of the methods mentioned in Hull. While this is (hopefully) much nicer to read code than the 
notebooks, it is the "naked" implementation.

## Tests
Unittests for the methods.

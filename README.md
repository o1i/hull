# Hull playground
This repo is an attempt to apply the content of Hull's book 'Options, Futures and other Derivatives' (10th edition) 
to real world data
in order to deepen my understanding of its contents. I make no claims regarding the correctness or efficiency of the 
implementations and welcome any input to improve the code.

The data used is (mostly) obtained from https://www.cmegroup.com or https://cboe.com.
